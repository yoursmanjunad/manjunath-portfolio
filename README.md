# Developer portfolio that's a 2D game

Inspired by the many creative 3D developer portfolios, I create one that's 2D instead.
This is meant as a template that you can use to build your own. It works on both desktop
and mobile.

Note: You need `Node.js` and `npm` installed on your machine.

`npm install` then `npm run dev`
